Decide on the task to be done.
Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
Work on the task.
End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5–10 minutes).[5]
Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodori.
After four pomodori are done, take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
